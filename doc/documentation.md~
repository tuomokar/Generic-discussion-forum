# Introduction

This app is for a discussion forum, made with PHP and PostgreSQL.

People can create new posts and read existing ones. Posts can be replies to another post.

Posts can be searched by the poster's name or by the subject or age of the post. Readers can also follow the reply chain.
By default only posts young enough are shown, along with information on whether or not the reader or other people of the community have read it. This information is viewable by any reader. Readers always identify themselves.

The administrator of the system has their own user interface through which they can administrate the user information of the users and what groups they belong to. They can also clean up the database and define topics the posts can be grouped by.
